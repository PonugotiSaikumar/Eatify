                            Moving to Jakarta a few years ago prompted Novi Yanti to consider starting her own business. She chose to develop her cooking skills, not only as a routine but also as an additional source of income. According to the owner of Pempek Dos Sriwijaya, culinary ventures have always been something enjoyable to explore, create, and of course, taste. Therefore, Novi decided to focus on the traditional Palembang culinary business, which is her hometown specialty, namely pempek.

                                    All Indonesians are familiar with pempek, a dish originating from Sumatra, particularly Palembang, which has fans everywhere. Pempek is generally made from fish and flour. However, a woman who once took a cooking course in one of the districts in the capital city combines fish and flour with other complementary ingredients such as dried shrimp, young papaya (kates), and eggs as fillings. All products of Pempek Dos Sriwijaya are handmade in her favorite kitchen. The dough-making process is Novi's favorite part because it requires precision in mixing the ingredients to maintain the unique flavor. Novi also always pays attention to the freshness of every ingredient used to produce pempek to create products that can satisfy the longing of pempek lovers in Palembang. </p>

                            By boldly innovating, preserving the unique taste, accepting suggestions and criticisms from customers, and keeping up with the developments in the culinary world, Novi hopes to continue revitalizing and advancing the products of Pempek Dos Sriwijaya to remain a favorite choice for friends at various events, times, and places.
